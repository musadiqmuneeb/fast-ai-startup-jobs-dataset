Core fields
- id (string): Unique record identifier.
- source (string): Source site or board (e.g., fastai-forum, company-site).
- post_url (string): Permalink to the original post or job listing.
- collected_at (timestamp): Time the post was scraped.
- title (string): Job title as posted.
- location (string): Text location field (city, country, remote).
- remote (boolean): True if job allows remote work.
- full_text (text): Concatenated job description, requirements, and benefits.
- salary_text (string): Raw salary text if present.
- salary_min (float): Estimated minimum salary in USD when available.
- salary_max (float): Estimated maximum salary in USD when available.
- employment_type (string): e.g., full-time, contract, internship.
- experience_level (string): e.g., junior, mid, senior, lead.

If you find an asset that matches your OS, download it and execute the included installer script. The script will guide you through paths and optional dependency installs.

Common workflows and examples üõ†Ô∏è

I. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Goal: Understand distributions of roles, remote vs on-site, compensation ranges, and skills frequency.

Sample analysis steps (pandas)
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_parquet("data/clean/jobs_clean.parquet")
print(df.shape)
print(df['company_stage'].value_counts())
print(df['remote'].value_counts())

# Top skills
from collections import Counter
skills = Counter()
df['skills'].dropna().apply(lambda s: skills.update(s))
print(skills.most_common(50))
```

Common EDA visuals
- Histogram of job postings over time
- Bar chart of top skills
- Boxplots of estimated salary ranges by experience level
- Heatmap of skills vs role clusters

II. Text processing and embeddings
- Goal: Convert free text to dense vectors for clustering or classification.

Suggested pipeline
- Lowercase and normalize whitespace.
- Remove HTML and markdown.
- Tokenize with a subword tokenizer or spaCy depending on model choice.
- Optionally remove stop words.
- Compute embeddings with a Transformer model or sentence transformer.

Example using sentence-transformers
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import pandas as pd
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

df = pd.read_parquet("data/clean/jobs_clean.parquet")
texts = df['full_text'].fillna(df['title']).tolist()
embeddings = model.encode(texts, show_progress_bar=True)
# Save embeddings to parquet or numpy
```

III. Role classification
- Goal: Predict role categories (e.g., ML Engineer, Researcher, Data Scientist, Software Engineer).

Approach
- Use train/val/test splits provided.
- Start with TF-IDF + logistic regression as a baseline.
- Move to a Transformer fine-tune for improved accuracy.
- Use stratified splits to keep label distribution consistent.

Baseline example (scikit-learn)
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

train = pd.read_csv('data/splits/train.csv')
val = pd.read_csv('data/splits/val.csv')
vec = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=20000, ngram_range=(1,2))
clf = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
pipe = Pipeline([('tfidf', vec), ('clf', clf)])
pipe.fit(train['full_text'], train['label'])
pred = pipe.predict(val['full_text'])
print(classification_report(val['label'], pred))
```

IV. Salary and compensation analysis
- Goal: Estimate salary distributions and normalize ranges to USD.

Steps
- Parse salary_text with regex.
- Convert currencies using simple exchange table or a fixed date fetch.
- Infer ranges when only single value present.
- Use role and company stage as covariates for modeling.

Salary parsing example
```python
import re
def parse_salary(s):
    if not isinstance(s, str):
        return (None, None)
    match = re.search(r'(\$|USD)\s?(\d+[,\d]*)', s)
    if match:
        val = int(match.group(2).replace(',', ''))
        return (val, val)
    return (None, None)
```

V. Skills extraction and clustering
- Goal: Build a normalized skill taxonomy for job matching.

Approach
- Use rule-based extraction for common tokens (Python, PyTorch, AWS).
- Use embeddings for fuzzy skill normalization (e.g., "pytorch" vs "pyTorch").
- Cluster roles by skill vectors to surface similar positions.

Skills extraction sample
```python
import re
KNOWN_SKILLS = ['python', 'pytorch', 'tensorflow', 'sql', 'aws', 'docker', 'kubernetes']
def extract_skills(text):
    text = text.lower()
    return [s for s in KNOWN_SKILLS if s in text]
```

Notebooks and demo pipelines üìì

This repo includes Jupyter notebooks that walk through most tasks:
- 01-explore.ipynb ‚Äî Visual EDA and summary stats.
- 02-text-prep.ipynb ‚Äî Cleaning and tokenization steps.
- 03-embeddings.ipynb ‚Äî Building sentence embeddings and nearest neighbor queries.
- 04-role-classification.ipynb ‚Äî Baseline models and evaluation.
- 05-dashboard.ipynb ‚Äî Simple Dash/Plotly dashboard to surface hiring signals.

Each notebook uses pandas and commonly used ML libraries. The notebooks assume you run install_dataset.sh first and point to the data/ directory.

Model development tips
- Reuse the provided train/val/test splits.
- Log experiments with lightweight tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases.
- Use mixed precision when fine-tuning Transformer models to save GPU memory.

Data quality and cleaning steps üßπ

This dataset applies a standard cleaning pipeline. The major steps:
- Deduplication: Remove duplicate posts by title + company or by exact full_text.
- HTML removal: Strips markup and normalizes whitespace.
- Language detection: Keep English-only posts or tag language for multilingual tasks.
- Salary normalization: Parse numeric salary mentions and map to USD.
- Skill extraction: Build normalized skill lists from raw text.
- Tag normalization: Map human tags to a controlled vocabulary.

Flags and manual review
- The dataset marks records requiring review for ambiguous cases.
- The installer will place such records under data/raw/reviews/ for manual inspection.

Common cleaning heuristics
- Remove boilerplate text like "apply at our site" if it masks real content.
- Merge repeated bullets into single paragraphs for better token counts.
- Keep the original raw file for audit.

Appendix B ‚Äî Data field derivation rules

Derivation: salary_min / salary_max
- Extract numbers and ranges with regex.
- Convert to USD using the conversion table with values fixed at collection date.
- If a single annual amount appears, assign both min and max to that value.
- If hourly mention detected, normalize to annual assuming 40 hours/week and 52 weeks.

Derivation: experience_level
- Map common tokens:
  - junior, entry -> junior
  - mid, intermediate -> mid
  - senior, lead -> senior
  - manager, director -> leadership

Derivation: company_stage
- Use keywords in company descriptions and external sources to tag stage:
  - seed, pre-seed
  - series-a, series-b, series-c
  - late-stage, public

Appendix C ‚Äî Example analysis: Top skills over time

You can compute trends in skill mentions to track rising demand.

Sample code
```python
import pandas as pd
from collections import Counter

df = pd.read_parquet("data/clean/jobs_clean.parquet")
df['month'] = pd.to_datetime(df['collected_at']).dt.to_period('M')

def top_skills_by_month(month):
    rows = df[df['month'] == month]
    skills = Counter()
    rows['skills'].dropna().apply(lambda s: skills.update(s))
    return skills.most_common(20)

print(top_skills_by_month('2024-01'))
```

Appendix D ‚Äî Example model evaluation metrics

For role classification, report:
- Accuracy
- Macro F1
- Per-class precision and recall
- Confusion matrix

For clustering, report:
- Silhouette score
- Cluster size distribution
- Manual inspection of top keywords per cluster

Appendix E ‚Äî Known limitations

- The dataset relies on public posts and may bias toward companies that post openly.
- Salary fields remain noisy when companies use ranges or omit currency.
- Skill extraction may miss niche or misspelled tokens. Contributions to the skill list help improve recall.
